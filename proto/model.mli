(** Claude AI model identifiers for protocol encoding.

    This module provides type-safe model identifiers with JSON encoding/decoding
    support via Jsont. Use polymorphic variants for known models with a custom
    escape hatch for future or unknown models. *)

type t =
  [ `Sonnet_4_5  (** claude-sonnet-4-5 - Most recent Sonnet model *)
  | `Sonnet_4  (** claude-sonnet-4 - Sonnet 4 model *)
  | `Sonnet_3_5  (** claude-sonnet-3-5 - Sonnet 3.5 model *)
  | `Opus_4  (** claude-opus-4 - Opus 4 model for complex tasks *)
  | `Haiku_4  (** claude-haiku-4 - Fast, cost-effective Haiku model *)
  | `Custom of string  (** Custom model string for future/unknown models *) ]
(** The type of Claude models. *)

val to_string : t -> string
(** [to_string t] converts a model to its string representation.

    Examples:
    - [`Sonnet_4_5] becomes "claude-sonnet-4-5"
    - [`Opus_4] becomes "claude-opus-4"
    - [`Custom "my-model"] becomes "my-model" *)

val of_string : string -> t
(** [of_string s] parses a model string into a typed model.

    Known model strings are converted to their typed variants. Unknown strings
    become [`Custom s].

    Examples:
    - "claude-sonnet-4-5" becomes [`Sonnet_4_5]
    - "future-model" becomes [`Custom "future-model"] *)

val jsont : t Jsont.t
(** [jsont] is the Jsont codec for model identifiers.

    This codec maps between the typed model representation and JSON strings. It
    uses [of_string] for decoding and [to_string] for encoding. *)
